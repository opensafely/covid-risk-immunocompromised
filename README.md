# Protocol and scripts
* Drafts of the study protocol are available in the **docs** folder.
* If you are interested in how we defined our variables, take a look at the **study_definition_wave[x].py** scripts in the **analysis** folder; these are written in `python`, but non-programmers should be able to get a relatively good idea of what is going on.
* If you are interested in how we defined our code lists, look in the [**codelists** folder](./codelists/).
* Developers and epidemiologists interested in the framework should review the [**OpenSAFELY documentation**](https://docs.opensafely.org)
